          Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few mutual friends, who happened to run a record label, seeking tracks

          the remix contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter, director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records, who
          boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week later, they were in his ofﬁce, signing a record deal. </p>
